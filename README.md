# Taco Truck Problem #

This is an exercise in array manipulation to determine the most optimal placement of a taco truck wihtin the city; to provide the shortest walking distance from several customers' locations.

### Problem: ###
An array of [x,y] coordinates corresponds to the locations of customers.
Determine from customers' locations where to park the taco truck to minimize the total distance from customers to truck.
The truck only parks on street corners, and customers only travel along streets (i.e. cardinal directions along x-y coordinates).


### Bonus ###
Write a proof to show the optimal location is correct.
