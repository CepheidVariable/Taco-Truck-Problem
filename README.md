#Taco Truck Problem#

###This is an exercise in array manipulation to determine the most optimal placement of a taco truck wihtin the city; to provide the shortest walking distance from several customers' locations.###

#####Problem:#####
You drive a taco truck; an array of [x,y] coordinates corresponds to the locations of your customers.
You need to minimize the total distance from truck to customers. The truck only parks on street corners
(at integer coordinates like [37,-16]; customers only travel on streets (coordinate [2,-2] is distance 4
from [0,0]). Given the customer array, determine the optimal place for taco truck to park.
